# Ego_The_Imphaliza
依法立加，坐落于坐落于世界边缘的古老王国，没有首都，没有国王，没有战争，但也没有人的迹象。

玩家在其中醒来，玩家将以自己的视角探索这个神秘而又危险的废土世界。

逃离？还是就在此定居？取决于玩家，取决于**你**。


Imphaliza, an ancient kingdom at the edge of the world.

There's no capital, no king, no war, and no human beings.

A player woke up. And this player would explore the mysteries of this dangerous waste earth world from its own perspective.

Escape? Or try to settle here? All of things depends on the player, depends on **YOU**.
